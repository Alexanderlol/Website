				<h3 class="logoFontTitle text-left">Understanding My Passion</h3>
				<p>In 2013 I graduated from Game Development at Algonquin College.<br>
				During my time there I struggled to find my passion in the development world and inevitably lost interest.<br>
				Roughly one year ago I began my journy into web development. I toyed around with todo applications in JS and frameworks like Angular and Ionic.<br>
				I recently dived into the world of ruby and the rails framework.
				Since my rails discovery I have found a huge interest in web development and I have been enjoying every minute of it.<br>
				Today I consider myself a Ruby on Rails Developer and hope to be employed one day using this immensely fun language and framework.
				While my skills are still improving, I look forward to every minute of development experience I am exposed to.</p>
